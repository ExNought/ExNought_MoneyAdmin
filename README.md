# ExNought_MoneyAdmin (working title)

This is my try to make an app that helps me and others to maintain an overview for their expenses. I will start with a desktop UI based in XAML. Later on I want to write the program itself in C++ as both a desktop app and an app for Android.

Maybe later down the road this can be portet to iOS. I am currently not sure as of how I will manage the license. I will start with the MIT one, could be there is a change later on, when this gets more serious.

Additionally there will with 100% certainty be a name change!

Also the features I want to include:

    - Categories for income and expenses
    - Scheduled expenses and incomes
    - Differing between payment-types 
    -> Cash is accounted for and doesn't "float" invisibly after cashout 
    -> Credit Cards sometimes work as debit, sometimes as "collect and pay at once"
    - Rules 
    -> e.g. Transactionfees, specific paymenttypes, warnings, etc.
    -Alerts
    -Reports 
    -> Including diagrams to illustrate moneyflow
